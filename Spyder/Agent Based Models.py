random - class generating pseudo random numbers
print - print function, often for strings
model - code which initiates, runs and tests our outputs.
agent - code which determines mathematical behaviours based on neighbourhood 
        or environment, often containing a list to allow agent communication.
environemnt - the platform or neighbourhood, a defined space in which Agents
              live. Typically a Raster grid.

# In the beginning.... humans felt compelled to "aggregate individual things 
# in order to understand their mass behaviour" (Geog.leeds.ac.uk, 2018).

# Agents are allowed to interact amoung themselves and with the environemnt.
# Here, we initialise the Agent.
